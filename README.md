# TCFA_scrape
# I created this python program to learn about scraping data from https://www.tncenturyfarms.org/farms/ 
# The website displays information on over 2100 century farms, 10 farms at a time. It was possible to cut and paste over 210 times, but by making this script in about 15 minutes I was able to automate the data transcription. I learned about the Selenium and Webdriver Python libraries.
# I will use the data to contact for interview and take notes on these 2100 farms.
